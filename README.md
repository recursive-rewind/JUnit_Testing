# JUnit_Testing

We could not properly test the source code of React Storefront, so we improvised and tested our semester project for Software Construction and Development course and tested it using JUnit and Jacoco. The code coverage report is 72 currently, with the exception statements (catch, and final clauses) being the only untested code.
